## Hackathon Project: BUILDWITHDELHI

Welcome to LunaWellness, our innovative project for the BUILDWITHDELHI hackathon. Our mission is to empower girls and young women by providing comprehensive and accessible knowledge about menstrual health and overall well-being.

### Project Overview

LunaWellness is designed to be a one-stop platform for all things related to menstrual health. We believe in equipping girls with the knowledge they need to understand their bodies and make informed choices.

#### Educational Content

*Understanding Menstruation*: Menstruation is a natural biological process, but it is often surrounded by myths and misinformation. At LunaWellness, we provide scientifically accurate information to help girls understand the science behind periods. We explain the menstrual cycle in detail, covering each phase - from menstruation and the follicular phase to ovulation and the luteal phase. By debunking common myths and providing clear explanations, we aim to empower girls with knowledge and confidence.

#### Period Products Guide

*Comprehensive Product Information*: Choosing the right period product can be overwhelming given the variety of options available. LunaWellness offers a comprehensive guide to different period products such as pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and period panties. We provide detailed information on the benefits and drawbacks of each product, how to use them properly, and tips for making the best choice based on individual needs and preferences.

#### Hormonal Imbalances

*Addressing PCOS/PCOD*: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) are common hormonal imbalances that affect many women. These conditions can cause a variety of symptoms, including irregular periods, weight gain, and acne. LunaWellness provides in-depth information about PCOS/PCOD, including symptoms, diagnosis, and management strategies. Our goal is to help girls understand these conditions better and provide practical advice for managing symptoms through lifestyle changes and medical treatments.

#### Well-being

*Promoting Holistic Health*: Menstrual health is closely linked to overall well-being. LunaWellness promotes a holistic approach to health by offering personalized diet plans, stress management techniques, and exercise routines. We provide nutritional advice to support menstrual health, stress-relief strategies to help manage menstrual-related stress, and exercise recommendations that can help alleviate menstrual symptoms and promote overall fitness.

#### Period Power: Period Tracker and More

*Period Tracker*: Our period tracker is designed to help girls keep track of their menstrual cycles with ease and accuracy. By inputting their cycle data, users can receive predictions about their next period. This tool not only helps in planning and preparation but also in identifying any irregularities that might require medical attention.

*Educational Resources*: We provide a wealth of educational resources on various aspects of menstrual health, including hygiene practices, safe sex during menstruation, and managing menstrual pain. Our aim is to equip girls with all the information they need to navigate their menstrual health confidently.

### Why LunaWellness?

The name "LunaWellness" symbolizes our vision of combining the natural rhythms of the lunar cycle with holistic wellness. Just as the moon goes through phases, so do womenâ€™s bodies. We believe in embracing these natural cycles and providing the care and support needed to navigate them with confidence and ease.
